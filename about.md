description: "Longhorn Riichi is a Riichi Mahjong club based in Austin, Texas. Established in late 2021, our primary goal is to promote and popularize Riichi in the West, starting within the UT Austin community. We achieve this objective by organizing frequent recruitment events and game sessions, offering the general public regular opportunities to learn and play Riichi free of charge.\n\nAt Longhorn Riichi, we strive to create an inclusive environment that welcomes casual and competitive players alike. Further, we aim to connect our members with other Riichi communities, such as [ARML](https://americanriichi.org/), fostering a sense of camaraderie and expanding the *reach* of Riichi beyond our local borders."
