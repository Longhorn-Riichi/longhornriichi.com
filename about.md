description: "Longhorn Riichi is a Japanese Mahjong (\"Riichi\") club based in Austin, Texas. It was founded in late 2021 with a mission to help popularize Riichi, starting with the UT Austin community. It accomplishes this mission by hosting regular recruitment events and game sessions where the general public may learn and play Riichi for free. Longhorn Riichi also aims to foster an inclusive environment for both casual and competitive players, as well as connect its members with other Riichi communites like [ARML](https://americanriichi.org/)."
