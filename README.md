## Repository Structure:
Developers should be most interested in the following:
- `/_data/`: content that is better stored as lists of values (`.json`) or a dictionary of key-value pairs (`.yml`) (as opposed to a `.md` article).
- `/_include/`: `.html` components that may be reused across different layouts.
- `/_layouts/`: the [Jekyll layouts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/04-layouts/).
- `/_sass/components/`: the style sheets for various components.
- `/assets/css/style.scss`: the style sheet entry point that defines some thematic variables and imports the above `components` style sheets.
