# UTA vs UTD tournament

The "UTA vs UTD" is a special friendly tournament we host during every major break of the UT system, pitting Longhorn Riichi ("UTA") against the UT Dallas Riichi Mahjong Association ("UTD").
- It is a team-based tournament consisting of 2 stages.
- Each stage has multiple tables with 2 players from each team.
- Each table plays 2 games per stage.
- Each player's score contributes to the respective team total.
